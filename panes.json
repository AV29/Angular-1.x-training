    "name": "Outpost",
    "content": "In a seedy bar in a town ravaged by war, scientist and businessman Hunt (Julian Wadham) hires former Royal Marine turned mercenary D.C. (Ray Stevenson) to assemble a crack team of ex-soldiers - Prior (Richard Brake), Jordan (Paul Blair), Cotter (Enoch Frost), Voytech (Julian Rivett), McKay (Michael Smiley) and Taktarov (Brett Fancy) - to protect him on a dangerous journey into no-man's land. Their mission is to scope out an old military bunker in Eastern Europe. Once at the outpost, the men make a horrific discovery that changes the dynamics of the entire mission: the scene of a bloody and gruesome series of occultistic Nazi experiments, carried out by the SS during World War II, using reality shifting and reanimation to create invincible soldiers. Amidst the carnage, they find a survivor, G?tz (Johnny Meres). At night, the clearing around the bunker is suddenly lit, and silhouettes of people are seen against the light. Soon after, Taktarov is gruesomely killed by an unseen foe. Later the same night Voyteche is killed by two Nazis. The next morning, Voyteche and Taktarov's dead bodies are found joined at the head, with Taktarov's skull containing a spent round. D.C. demands answers regarding the assignment from Hunt: an unnamed corporation wanted Hunt to find and recover a large generator-like device responsible for the SS's reality-shifting experiments. D.C. orders Cotter to retrieve Hunt from the generator room. While trying to convince Hunt to leave, Cotter is killed by an SS soldier with a pickaxe. It is revealed that G?tz is actually a surviving SS brigadier general - a 'breather.' When Prior kills G?tz, the 'breather' comes back to life and MacKay is killed. The mercenaries and Hunt attempt to evacuate the outpost, only to be slaughtered by the undead German army. A second corporate team arrives 72 hours later to carry out the same assignment, only to find a 'breather' among the piles of naked corpses. The clearing is lit again, revealing the illuminated soldiers surrounding the bunker. In the distance stands the brigadier general, who gives the SS soldiers a nod, and they begin their assault on the team."

    "name": "Jaws",
    "content": "Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Peter Benchley's 1974 novel of the same name. In the story, a giant man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers on Amity Island, a fictional New England summer resort town, prompting the local police chief to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist and a professional shark hunter. The film stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint, Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Murray Hamilton as Larry Vaughn, the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. The screenplay is credited to both Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography. Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks suffered many malfunctions, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures gave the film what was then an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture, over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise. Now considered one of the greatest films ever made, Jaws was the prototypical summer blockbuster, with its release regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history. Jaws became the highest-grossing film of all time until the release of Star Wars (1977). It won several awards for its soundtrack and editing. Along with Star Wars, Jaws was pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which revolves around high box-office returns from action and adventure pictures with simple 'high-concept' premises that are released during the summer in thousands of theaters and supported by heavy advertising. It was followed by three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, Jaws was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'."
